# DFVG: A Heterogeneous Architecture for Speculative Decoding with Draft-on-FPGA and Verify-on-GPU

**DFVG (Draft-on-FPGA, Verify-on-GPU)** is a heterogeneous computing architecture designed for **speculative decoding** in large language models.  
The key idea is to perform the **draft generation** stage on FPGAs for fast parallel candidate generation, and the **verification** stage on GPUs for efficient matrix computation. This design fully leverages the complementary strengths of both hardware platforms to achieve **low latency and high throughput** decoding.
